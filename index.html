                    Can you start by introducing yourself?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm Michael Sadecky, and I was born not too far from here, at the Allegheny Valley Hospital in Natrona Heights. We are here because she came down during the Tarentum night market and started asking questions. I was thinking about doing a documentary of us going out of business, but my brother didn't want to participate. So it kind of didn't go anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like documenting what the experience was like, or…?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yeah, like a story of a family-owned business, going out of business. And talking about what we did through the years, 39 years in business, and all the places that we went to, and, of course, we can’t talk about all of them. But we did go to 21 states, and our busiest year we did 1200 shows in one year. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    How long is one show? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    About 40 minutes. When we started, they were half-hour shows, and then we lengthened them because by the time the kids would come in and, and leave and we did the introduction, it kind of made it almost an hour, you know, so, but 40 minutes was kind of like, the attention span of the room, you know?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can’t keep kids for too long. Was it all, always kids? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    No, I mean, we did shopping malls and festivals and stuff like that. In the early years, we did birthday parties, but then it became too expensive for people to afford for birthdays. Except my uncle lawyer hired us once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Was puppeting something that you always imagined for yourself or something you always wanted to do, or how did you get into it? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It just kind of happened. We were very young. And our parents bought us a set of little hand puppets. And we were behind the couch, making up shows when we were in grade school. And then when I was in sixth grade, I was in the Webelos, which is between the Cub Scouts and the Boy Scouts. They have a ribbon badge that you put on your uniform that had three cloth ribbons. I just had it in my hand yesterday, I should have brought it but anyway, you tried to earn little pins to go on to those ribbons. And one of them was, you could build three puppets, and I went to the library and got some books on puppets, and I built three puppets, and that was about it for then. That was in Colorado, when we lived in Colorado. Then it came back here and I saw Jim Henson from, you know the Muppets. I saw a special he did on PBS. And he showed some behind the scenes stuff and kind of piqued my interest. I also saw the Creegan Puppets which were out of Ohio. They were doing a show at the Monroeville Mall. I was standing on the top floor looking down and watching how they came in and out with their puppets, and that kind of interested me too. So when I was 13, I started making some stages and I went out and did shows. Like two or three shows. But my first show was right across the street over there. When we started doing puppets in ‘81, we kind of went off of this picture here, see how they're on chairs. We found out that it's really bad for your back. Then I found this picture later. I'm like, ‘Oh, they're standing up. Now they learned their lesson’. I must have stared at this picture, off and on if you added up the time, probably six months of my life. Looking at this picture, getting ideas. If you see this, I have my own Kermit that I made. That's supposed to be Prairie Dawn, which is this girl here. And looking out the window there is Guy Smiley. And I think Smiley is in this picture too, I’m looking at it upside down. Oh, yeah, he's right there behind Jim Henson. That kind of looks like this guy.
